# AmazonNotification
Fetch Product from amazon and show the current price and set mail notification if required
To run the project we need to install flask and python 2.7 & required credentials from amazon associate account.
like AccessKey, SecretKey, AssociateTag
after installing the flask go to the folde and run the file app.py as "python app.py" server will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Thanks!
